ü§ñ Current Jarvis Capabilities (What It Actually Has)
‚úÖ WORKING Capabilities:
1. Intelligent Workflow Engine

LangGraph state machine: PLAN ‚Üí RETRIEVE ‚Üí DECIDE ‚Üí ACT/SELF_UPGRADE ‚Üí FINAL
Context retrieval: Uses vector search to find relevant past interactions
Decision making: GPT-4o-mini with Christ-centered manifesto guardrails
Policy enforcement: Blocks actions outside allowed parameters
2. Available Tools (Limited but Functional)

docs.write: Create/write any file with content
notify.owner: Send Telegram messages (tested & working)
compose.apply: Infrastructure changes (simulated on Heroku)
3. Learning & Memory (Basic)

Vector storage: Automatically ingests all tool results into Qdrant
Context retrieval: Can find and use previous interactions for similar goals
Embeddings: Uses bge-small-en-v1.5 for semantic similarity
4. Self-Reflection

Manifesto-guided: Every decision checked against Christ-centered principles
Guardrails: Won't exceed $200/month, won't expose secrets, etc.
Impact tracking: Designed to measure hours saved, people helped, etc.
‚ùå MISSING Capabilities (What It Can't Do Yet)
1. True Self-Learning

‚ùå Can't install new packages or modify its own code
‚ùå Can't create new tools dynamically
‚ùå No persistent learning between Heroku restarts (in-memory only)
‚ùå Can't improve its own algorithms
2. Limited Tool Ecosystem

‚ùå No web scraping or data ingestion tools
‚ùå No database access beyond vector storage
‚ùå No API integration tools (can't call external APIs)
‚ùå No file system exploration or analysis tools
3. No Advanced Reasoning

‚ùå Can't break down complex multi-day projects
‚ùå No persistent task tracking or project management
‚ùå Can't learn from failures and retry with different approaches
üöÄ What It Would Need to Become Truly Self-Building
1. Tool Creation Engine

# Missing: Dynamic tool creation
def create_tool(name, description, code):
    # Generate new tool files
    # Add to allowed_actions
    # Reload tool system
2. Package Management

# Missing: Dependency management
def install_package(package_name):
    # Update requirements.txt
    # Restart with new dependencies
3. Persistent Learning

# Missing: External knowledge base
def learn_from_interaction(goal, result, success):
    # Store in persistent database
    # Update decision patterns
    # Improve future performance
4. Web & API Integration

# Missing: External data access
def research_topic(query):
    # Web search and scraping
    # API calls to external services
    # Data synthesis and storage

Implementation details required for full, self-building Jarvis

1) Chat interface and runtime
- Current: Telegram long-polling via `web_jarvis.py`; health endpoint for Heroku.
- Required for production stability:
  - Webhook mode with secret token, path `/telegram/<token>` and IP allowlist. Fallback to long-polling.
  - Command routing: `/start`, `/help`, `/goal <text>`, `/status`, `/cancel`.
  - Authorization model: only `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is allowed; add optional `ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` list.
  - Rate limits and backoff on Telegram errors.
  - Structured replies: include decision type, tool results summary, and error traces when safe.

Core Feature Sets (Built vs Planned)

- Chat Interface (Telegram)
  - Built: Webhook endpoint `/telegram/<token>` with `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; webhook auto-setup from `APP_BASE_URL`; NL boot greeting; commands `/start`, `/help`, `/status`, `/goal`; auth via `ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS`; health at `/health` with counters.
  - Planned: Rate limiting/backoff; IP allowlist; `/cancel` semantics.
- Workflow Engine
  - Built: LangGraph PLAN‚ÜíRETRIEVE‚ÜíDECIDE‚Üí(ACT|SELF_UPGRADE)‚ÜíFINAL; checkpointer with per-thread `thread_id` for Telegram and CLI.
  - Planned: Postgres checkpointer when `DATABASE_URL` present.
- Tools
  - Built: `docs.write`, `notify.owner`, `compose.apply` (Heroku-sim), `ingest.source`, `archive.data` (stub), `track.finances`.
  - Planned: Tool engine (dynamic tool creation); package management edits + deploy notify.
- Retrieval/Memory
  - Built: Embeddings bge-small; in-memory Qdrant by default; optional external Qdrant via `QDRANT_URL`/`QDRANT_API_KEY`.
  - Planned: Archival policy and cold storage tagging.
- LLM & Policy
  - Built: OpenAI chat completions; proxy via httpx if env set; DECIDE prompt uses `allowed_actions` from manifesto; router enforces guardrails.
  - Planned: Cost awareness and monthly budget tracking.
- Observability & Impact
  - Built: Health counters (decisions/actions/errors) in `/health`.
  - Planned: Structured logs to `logs/` and periodic impact summaries.

2) Checkpoints and persistence
- Current: in-memory `MemorySaver` checkpointer + in-memory Qdrant.
- Required:
  - Persistent checkpointer: Postgres (Heroku Postgres) via `DATABASE_URL`. Thread routing: `thread_id = <chat_id>`.
  - Durable vector store: external Qdrant (Cloud or managed) using `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`.
  - Backfill/ingest: ingest important repo files and tool outputs automatically.

3) Tool ecosystem and dynamic growth
- Current tools: `docs.write`, `compose.apply` (simulated on Heroku), `notify.owner`.
- Required:
  - Tool creation engine: generate `tools/<name>.py` and `<name>.yaml`, validate schema, reload registry.
  - Safe tool registry: only tools whitelisted in `manifesto.yaml.guardrails.allowed_actions` may run.
  - Package management pathway: edits to `requirements.txt` via `docs.write` + deploy notification; avoid runtime pip installs on Heroku.
  - Add foundational tools (later exposed in DECIDE prompt):
    - ingest.source: read file/URL, chunk, embed, store.
    - archive.data: move older vectors to cold storage index or tag for archival.
    - track.finances: CSV ingest + basic aggregation (scaffold only).

4) Decision and policy
- Current: DECIDE prompt returns only FINAL | ACT(docs.write|compose.apply|notify.owner) | SELF_UPGRADE.
- Required:
  - Expand prompt to allow the new safe tools once implemented.
  - Keep policy guardrails as the single source of truth; deny at router.
  - Cost awareness: track estimated token spend per decision and aggregate to monthly budget from manifesto.

5) Observability and impact ledger
- Structured logs of goals, decisions, and tool outcomes (redact secrets).
- Periodic summary to owner: hours_freed_per_week, people_helped_count, etc.
- Health metrics endpoint: decisions/min, success rate, last error.

Environment variables to add (do not commit values)
- DATABASE_URL: Postgres connection string for LangGraph checkpointer
- QDRANT_URL: External Qdrant endpoint (e.g., https://xxxx.qdrant.tech)
- QDRANT_API_KEY: Qdrant API key
- ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS: Optional comma-separated list of additional chat IDs
- TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Shared secret for webhook route

Backlog TODOs (implementation-ready)
- [x] Telegram: add webhook endpoint `/telegram/<token>`; verify secret; disable polling when webhook configured
- [x] Telegram: implement `/start`, `/help`, `/goal`, `/status` handlers (partial; `/cancel` pending)
- [x] Auth: support `ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` list in addition to `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
- [ ] Checkpointer: add Postgres checkpointer when `DATABASE_URL` present; fallback to memory
- [x] Vectors: support external Qdrant when `QDRANT_URL` set; fallback to in-memory
- [x] Ingest: implement `tools/ingest.py` and `tools/ingest.yaml` (reads local file path)
- [x] Archive: implement `tools/archive.py` and `tools/archive.yaml` (stub tag)
- [x] Finances: implement `tools/track_finances.py` and YAML with minimal CSV ingest + sum by category
- [ ] Tool engine: create `services/tool_engine.py` with `create_tool()` that writes files safely and reloads
- [ ] Package mgmt: create `services/deps.py` with `propose_dependency_update()` that edits `requirements.txt`
- [x] DECIDE: extend allowed tool list in prompt using `allowed_actions`
- [ ] Observability: add structured logging to `logs/` (counters present in `/health`)
- [ ] Impact: scheduled Telegram summary with impact ledger aggregates

How to chat now
- Open Telegram and message your Jarvis bot in natural language (no command required). Optionally use `/goal <text>`.
- Webhook is active; replies should arrive in the chat. Use `/status` for quick metrics.

Acceptance criteria
- Bot accepts `/goal <text>` and returns a FINAL or ACT/SELF_UPGRADE status + action count
- State and memory survive dyno restarts when `DATABASE_URL` and `QDRANT_URL` are configured
- Only authorized chat IDs can trigger actions
- Tool creation attempts outside allowed_actions are blocked by policy
- No secrets are ever echoed back in messages or logs
